- first the the loopy way
- than came up with the function to find the *time_held* to reach the record distance
  
record distance = time_held * (time - time_held)

- formed that function a little to be able to use the quadratic formula to find the 2 x values for which the record distance get accomplished

0 = time_held^2 - time*time_held + record distance

- calculated the difference between the 2 x values to find the range or possible ways of how to beat the record
